#' Find overlaps between mutations and a genomic region
#' 
#' Function finds the number of mutations that reside in genomic region and takes surveyed area of genome into account
#' @param vcf_list A list with vcf Granges objects
#' @param surveyed_list A list with Granges of regions of the genome that have been surveyed (e.g. determined using GATK CallableLoci)
#' @param region_list List with GRanges objects containing locations of genomic regions
